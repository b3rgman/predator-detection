# predator-detection-system


# Purpose


---

I am doing the experiment to figure out how to keep animals safe from the predators outside.  The benefit of my experiment is how to save domestic animals from getting harmed and how to build a system using a Raspberry Pi. 

# Problem


---

The problem is a lot of animals with no or little protection are dying because of predators. The goal is to find a way to prevent predators from harming animals.

# Hypothesis


---

My hypothesis is that the amount of animals getting harmed  will decrease by using my predator detection system. This will allow domestic animals to be more safe on a farm or backyard. I think the results will be less animals harmed.


# Materials


---

Raspberry Pi

Motion Sensor

Breadboard

LED Lights

Speakers

Computer

Terminal Block

Buttons

Raspberry Pi case

Volume knob

Wood

Screws

12V Battery

Wires

Hot Glue Gun

Power Pack

Charging Block


# Procedure


---


 1. Research how to scare predators away.
 2. Research how to keep animals safe.
 3. Star hypothesis on less animals dying.
 4. Gather materials.
 5. Start coding Python on Raspberry Pi
 6. Create 3D Printed case for Raspberry Pi
 7. Hook up breadboard to Raspberry Pi.
 8. Connect lights to 12v battery.
 9. Connect motion sensor to breadboard.
10. Connect speakers to Raspberry Pi.


# Research


---

Most common predators in PA are foxes, coyotes, bears, raccoons, hawks and fishers.


## Times predators are out


---

Foxes -  Daytime and noon Coyotes - Dawn and sunset Bears - Dusk and dawn; nighttime Raccoons - Dawn and dusk Fishers - daytime and dawn. Hawks - evening and morning (PennsylvaniaGame Commission)

## Fears


---

Bright Lights and loud noises

## What they eat


---

Foxes - cats, chickens, small dogs and birds Coyotes - Sometimes hurt house pets.  Eat dear and small rodents. Hawks - small mammals and birds Bears - Can harm house pets.  Eat berries Raccoons - Small animals Fishers - Can eat Squirrels, mice and chipmunks.


# Conclusion


---

During my experiment I learned how to solder, write code in Python for the Raspberry Pi, woodworking by using a circular saw,  using heat activated sensors and electrical wiring. My experiment had good results that can make an effective predator proof system to keep domestic animals safe.  Having dead domestic animals would have affected the results of the experiment by predators not being able to smell them. The results from my Predator Detection System was that no animals were harmed.


# Summary


---

My science project is how to prevent domestic animals Example: Pet dog, cat, chicken or ducks from getting harmed by predators.  It consists of a Raspberry Pi, motion sensor, wires, breadboard lights and speakers. Whenever motion is detected, it will shine a bright light and make other animal noises to scare predators away.


# Bible Verse


---

Deuteronomy 31:6 Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or terrified because of them, for the LORD your God goes with you; he will never leave you nor forsake.


This bible verse is a reminder to be strong when you feel not protected.  The Biblical truth that I've learned with this bible verse is not to be afraid or weak because the Lord is with you at all times.
